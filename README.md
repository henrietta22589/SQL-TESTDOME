# üß† SQL Projects & TestDome Certification

## üìú Overview
This repository showcases my **SQL learning journey**, hands-on problem solving, and the official **TestDome SQL Certificate** that places me in the **Top 25% globally** (March 14, 2025).

I developed and tested all SQL scripts here as part of practical exercises designed to simulate real-world database tasks, including **data creation, manipulation, joins, aggregation, and relational modeling**.

## üìö What I Learned

Through the exercises and certification process, I strengthened my ability to:
- Design **normalized relational databases** (`CREATE TABLE`, `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`)
- Perform **complex joins** and **set operations** (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `UNION`)
- Implement **data manipulation** queries (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)
- Use **aggregate functions** (`COUNT`, `AVG`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`)
- Apply **conditional logic** and handle **case sensitivity** in SQL
- Model **self-referential relationships** (e.g., employee‚Äìmanager hierarchy)
- Write **clean, reusable, and efficient** SQL code
